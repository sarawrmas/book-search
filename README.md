## Description
This is a simple book search engine that uses Google's Books API. Simply use the search bar to look up any title or author and results will be displayed.

This website can be used without logging in for view-only mode, but signing up for an account unlocks access to a feature that allows you to save books to a wishlist. After finding your desired book, simply hit the attached save button.

You can view your wishlist on a separate page using the navigation bar. Once there, you will see a complete list of all of your saved books with the option to remove any you are finished reading or no longer interested in.
